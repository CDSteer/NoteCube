NoteCube
========

The main focus of the project is ambient notification, too many notifications we receive today are intrusive and distracting. They often take us off task or take us out of our environment to looking down at screens and requiring too much of our attention to interpret simple information.

NoteCube will give you power over your notifications, it will make notifications part of your life, not something demanding you away from it.
